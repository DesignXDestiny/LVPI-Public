# LVPI-Public
Las Vegas Pain Institute Directory


## What?
LVPI  - Public is a Directory of information for navigating and expediting workflow.  These are resources all LVPI personnel should have access to. 

### Who is it For?
Expected users: LVPI employees.
Referral specialists, schedulers, who ever is preparing the charts. 

### Why?
LVPI - Public is useful to contact other Employees, via extension (phone). Find a specialist with whom LVPI has established a positive rapport.  Find the sites that we use to verify Benefits and Elegibility, and get Laboratory Results.Everytime an employee needs access or contact information it is frustrating to not only stop what you're doing, but also someone else to ask. I believe that everyone who works here deserves access to these tools.

### How to Use It:

### Contributor
I am the sole writter of code and project manager of this. I leave the collecting of new information and responsibility of delivering to LVPI's interested employees.  Which means that I will eventually end up doing it myself.  Anyone's input is greatly appreciated.
